* Caitlin Prentke's Front-End Coding Challenge

** To run locally:

- `cd nyt-coding-challenge`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- By default, the app will run on localhost:3000.

** Notes

- I first built the forms using Bootstrap's React components, then refactored the duplicated form components into their own smaller components to make cleaner code.
- I then added some custom CSS to center the forms, but I kept the design as clean and simple as possible.
- I used React Router for the routing as it's easy to use and I didn't anticipate any need for a custom router.
- I tried to mimic the functionality of the login and register forms, hence the fakeFetch functions.
